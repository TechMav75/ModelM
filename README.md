# Model M to USB converter

This is a drop in replacement for the controller board on an IBM Model M keyboard, part number 1391401.

You will find Gerber files, controller files, and the BOM to build your own board.

The board is designed to accomodate 16/12 pin and 16/8/4 pin setups. You will need to check your keyboard controller to see which connectors you will need.

If you need the 16/8/4 pin style, install the 8pin Trio Mate in the left hand holes of the 12pin connector. The 4pin will go in the obvious place on the right of the board.
